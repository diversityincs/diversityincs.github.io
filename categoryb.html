          as like the latest technology goes. [...] I just didn’t agree with how the curriculum was structured. It was
          so archaic, that's not how the real world works [...] … So i just decided to finish my degree and self study
          the programming i wanted to learn. Well it was also, i just got this job at Intel and I was realizing that

          Most students we spoke with emphasized how stressful the proficiency demos are. Students recounted losing
          sleep, or worrying about the demos for weeks before hand.

          “ <strong>I took this course three times.</strong> And, I took it three times because
          of the proficiency demo. [I scored between 80 and 95 on all programs and tests.] So, <strong>it wasn’t the
            course
            content it was the mid-term demo specifically.</strong> I was kind of dumb-founded when I got to the end of
          the second
          class and I realized I wasn’t going to pass. I was like ‘I’m doing all the practice problems… and I’m still
          not
          passing. And then, I talked to other people about it and they were like <strong>‘yeah the questions you get in
            the demo
            are just different’.</strong> ”
