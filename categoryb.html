          as like the latest technology goes. [...] I just didn’t agree with how the curriculum was structured. It was
          so archaic, that's not how the real world works [...] … So i just decided to finish my degree and self study
          the programming i wanted to learn. Well it was also, i just got this job at Intel and I was realizing that
          what i learned in school wasn’t really applying."

          Most students we spoke with emphasized how stressful the proficiency demos are. Students recounted losing
          sleep, or worrying about the demos for weeks before hand.

          “ <strong>I took this course three times.</strong> And, I took it three times because
          of the proficiency demo. [I scored between 80 and 95 on all programs and tests.] So, <strong>it wasn’t the
            course
            content it was the mid-term demo specifically.</strong> I was kind of dumb-founded when I got to the end of
          the second
          class and I realized I wasn’t going to pass. I was like ‘I’m doing all the practice problems… and I’m still
          not
          passing. And then, I talked to other people about it and they were like <strong>‘yeah the questions you get in
            the demo
            are just different’.</strong> ”
