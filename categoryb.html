          as like the latest technology goes. [...] I just didn’t agree with how the curriculum was structured. It was
          so archaic, that's not how the real world works [...] … So i just decided to finish my degree and self study
          the programming i wanted to learn. Well it was also, i just got this job at Intel and I was realizing that
          what i learned in school wasn’t really applying."

        <p>“ <strong>I took this course three times.</strong> And, I took it three times because
        of the proficiency demo. [I scored between 80 and 95 on all programs and tests.] So, <strong>it wasn’t the course
        content it was the mid-term demo specifically.</strong> I was kind of dumb-founded when I got to the end of the second
        class and I realized I wasn’t going to pass. I was like ‘I’m doing all the practice problems… and I’m still not
        passing. And then, I talked to other people about it and they were like <strong>‘yeah the questions you get in the demo
        are just different’.</strong> ”

        “ Our curriculum is largely based on individual work and not group work [...] You're not really expected to work
        with anybody... I don't know if anyone can learn that way, and that does affect underrepresented folks more
        because they don't have external support. They didn't grow up with maybe extra money for a tutor or they didn't
        grow up with parents who were in engineering. So just being allowed to talk to your peers, I feel like is a big
        [help] for underrepresented folks.”

        “Another thing that's lacking is the knowledge of a wider range of jobs that are computer science related. Like
        there’s more than just programming … [In my CS classes, the professor] would talk down in classes, “awww look
        I’m a designer, I have to put on my designer hat. Blah blah”. Then when it came to the programmer [they] would
        be like “Now I have my programmer hat and I can think clearly.” It was like [they were] demeaning designers. I
        didn’t even think twice about it [at the time]."
