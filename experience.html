        Department at Portland State University, a team of students interviewed their peers and asked them to share

          Have you ever taken a class where you were the only person of your race or gender in that class? it can feel
          isolating on top of everything else and all the other stresses of being a college student. For this project,
          we were curious about the intersection of diversity and student retention. We conducted interviews with
          students regarding their
          experiences in the Computer Science program at Portland State University, with a focus on why students leave
          the program or why they
          consider leaving.
          What you see here are some excerpts from our student experience interviews. We hope that
          this will shed some light on what the department is like from some students’ perspectives.

          classes,</strong> and that’s obviously discouraging to hear when you’re first starting, is that that’s the kind of
          mentality that the school takes on... It’s a much better environment to have your professors rooting for you
          to get through, not hoping that students will fall off because they’re not smart enough... or creating an
          environment where students succeed.”</p>

          is breathing over you. And you make a mistake and you can hear their pen writing down your mistake. So it's
          like super nerve racking. And again, if you have anxiety you go into a block. It’s like 2+2 you put that in a
          calculator because your mind is going into overdrive. ”

          “ The professor [...] was always very intimidating. [They] never seemed like the person that you want to
          go ask for help. Like [they] had very specific rules about the type of questions we could ask and like the
          type of knowledge we had to have in order to go ask [them] some questions and how [they weren’t] going to
          explain some things.
          [They] would just exclaim in class that ‘you should know this?’ ‘I don’t want to receive questions like
          this.’”
