        Science
        Department at Portland State University, a team of students interviewed their peers and asked them to share
        their

            <strong>Have you ever taken a class where you were the only person of your race or gender present?</strong>
            It can feel isolating. Adding that to all the other stresses of being a college student can make it quite a
            challenge.
            For this project,
            we were curious about the intersection of diversity and student retention. We conducted interviews with
            students regarding their
            experiences in the Computer Science program at Portland State University.
            What you see here are some excerpts from our student experience interviews. We hope that
            this will shed some light on what the department is like from some students’ perspectives.
