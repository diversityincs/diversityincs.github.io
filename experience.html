      <p class="lead">During Summer term of 2020, as part of an ongoing research project within the Computer Science Department at Portland State University, a team of students interviewed their peers and asked them to share their experiences.</p>

        “Have you ever taken a class where you were the only person of your race or gender in that class?” It can feel isolating, especially dealing with that on top of all the other stresses of being a college student in a very difficult major. One CS Student of color describes this: 
      </p>
      <p class="quote" style="color: darkmagenta; width: 50%;">
        “I just still didn't feel like I belonged... I step into a room and – I mean I still have the confidence to just… suppress those feelings – but it's hard to ignore when I walk into a room and I'm the only person that looks like me.”
      </p>
      <p>
      One of the main themes we explored is what makes someone decide to leave the CS program? Of course a lot of people stick with it regardless  of their struggles and end up graduating. But for those who do leave, why do they leave?  One student we talked to who did leave said:
     </p>
      <p class="quote" style="color: mediumblue; width: 70%; text-align:  right;">“I just quit also because I feel like most people who come out of bootcamps are more job ready, as far as like the latest technology goes [, and] I just didn’t agree with how the curriculum was structured. It was so archaic, that's not how the real world works [...] … So i just decided to finish my degree and self study the programming i wanted to learn. Well it was also, i just got this job at Intel and I was realizing that what i learned in school wasn’t really applying. 
        […]I would have been much further along if I would have just honestly quit sooner.”</p>
