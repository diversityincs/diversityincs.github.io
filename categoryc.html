          "I would say the one that has been maybe the most helpful so far was I joined the computer action team back
          when I started at PSU, and so that was really a great group of people who I felt like they were really open to
          being, like, oh, if you have any problems in your classes since Carla's classes are really tough, you can ask
          any of us. And I did end up making a couple of good friends there who I still talk to to this day, who I reach
          out to for support."
