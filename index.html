          <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This project started in our explorations in data science class over the summer of 2020. The lack of diversity, and what affects retention, came to mind as a topic for our class project. Very quickly the project expanded out of the scope of that class project&hellip;</span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our first step was to look at some numbers to know specifics about the demographics and the retention. We were able to get some initial data from the department. That data told a very simple story. Women make up a small portion of the CS student body in universities overall, and the numbers at Portland State are even lower, and the upper division CS ratio is even lower still. </span></p>
          <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Over Fall 2020, we were able to get some more data. Something the data kept showing us is that not only is the department not diverse to start out with, women and people in underrepresented minority groups appear more likely to leave the program.</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Along with gathering and analyzing the data, we conducted interviews with students regarding their experiences in the program to understand what was happening, why students leave the program. Why does it seem like all of the growth in the department is just the sheer number white students increasing? This is the beginning of this project in some ways, there are further iterations planned, but we wanted to share with you the things we have found so far.</span></p>
