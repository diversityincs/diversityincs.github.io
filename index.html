          <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This project started in our explorations in data science class over the summer of 2020. The lack of diversity, and what affects retention, came to mind as a topic for our class project. Very quickly the project expanded out of the scope of that class project&hellip;</span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our first step was to look at some numbers to know specifics about the demographics and the retention. We were able to get some initial data from the department. That data told a very simple story. For one, the PSU CS department has lower than average participation from women. Compared to the national average of 19%,  only 17% of the students in Portland State’s lower division are women, and in PSU upper division, even lower at 11%. Looking at numbers from 2010-2017, persistence/graduation rates were lower for women than men. While the department has seen significant growth in the last few years, the number of students who are women and people of color are very low. 
          </span></p>
          <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Over Fall 2020, we were able to get some more data. Something the data kept showing us is that not only is the department not diverse to start out with, women and people in underrepresented minority groups appear more likely to leave the program.</span></p>
          <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
          <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A major portion of this project has focused on Student Perspectives. Why do students leave? What difficulties to students who complete the program face? We interviewed students to find out. Our results are forthcoming. Until then, check out the project process ( so far…), the history of women’s participation in computing, and some data and information regarding Portland state.
